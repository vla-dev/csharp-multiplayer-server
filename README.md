# csharp-multiplayer-server

## Establish TCP / UDP communication between client and server.
The server is running on main thread at 30 ticks / second.
It's not finished, and currently has implemented only 3 types of packets:
<br/>
 <ul>
    <li>welcome</li>
    <li>spawnPlayer</li>
    <li>playerPosition</li>
 </ul>

 The main scope was to use it with Unity 3D built games.
